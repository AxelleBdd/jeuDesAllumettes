This project is an individual exercise.
I had 1 week to go as far as I could.
It utilize every thing studied during the week.
We where able to choose between Javascript and Python. 
Because it was at the beginig of the trainig, I did it in Javascript.

For this exercise, I had to create a game where there are 50 matches.
One by one, every player takes between 1 and 6 mathces.
The one who takes the last one wins.
